# final-project-team7
- This is the final project of team7 in NTHU 2022 fall Game Programming course
- If this is the first time to clone this project, or some font is not **pixel art**, follow the instructions below to gain pixel-style-font.
  1. Uncompress "\Assets\PlayText\Font.zip"
  2. You will get 1 folder and 1 file:
      - font/
      - font.meta/
  3. Place these files in "\Assets\PlayText\"
  4. And **DON'T** delete the .zip file
  5. Now you should have pixel-style-font throughout the game!
